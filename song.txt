In place of warm is green glass,
In place of fire is smoke.
From calender taken the day.
The red sun burning to ashes,
Day burns with it.
The ray falling on the flaming city

Our hearts require the changes,
Our eyes require the changes,
Into our laugh and our tears,
And into pulse of veins
Changes!
We are waiting for changes.
